            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>I am a software engineer with a background in engineering. As a civil engineer, I enjoy solving problems in the most unorthodox way and creating projects that the general public uses everyday. During my time in project management, I became very passionate about technology more specifically, artificial intelligence in construction.  And on May 2021, I made a decision to study software engineering in hope to make a bigger impact on society.</p>
